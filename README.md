## Theme installation


### via Command-line

If you're already [using Composer to manage WordPress](https://roots.io/using-composer-with-wordpress/), then you might consider using composer's `create-project` command to download Sage.

The example below assumes you're using Bedrock. If you're not, simply change the target path accordingly.

```sh
composer create-project roots/sage web/app/themes/your-theme-name-here
```

Then activate the theme via [wp-cli](http://wp-cli.org/commands/theme/activate/).

```sh
wp theme activate your-theme-name-here
```

### via WordPress Admin Panel

1. [Download the latest release](https://github.com/roots/sage/releases/latest) of Sage.
2. In your WordPress admin panel, navigate to Appearance->Themes
3. Click Add New
4. Click Upload Theme
5. Upload the zip file that you downloaded.

## Theme setup

Edit `lib/setup.php` to enable or disable theme features, setup navigation menus, post thumbnail sizes, post formats, and sidebars.

## Theme development

Sage uses [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) as its build system and [npm](http://npmjs.com/) to manage front-end packages.

### Install gulp 

Building the theme requires [node.js](http://nodejs.org/download/). We recommend you update to the latest version of npm: `npm install -g npm@latest`.

From the command line:

1. Install [gulp](http://gulpjs.com) globally with `npm install -g gulp`
2. Navigate to the theme directory, then run `npm install`

You now have all the necessary dependencies to run the build process.

### Available gulp commands

* `gulp` — Compile and optimize the files in your assets directory
* `gulp watch` — Compile assets when file changes are made
* `gulp --production` — Compile assets for production (no source maps).

### Using BrowserSync

To use BrowserSync during `gulp watch` you need to update `devUrl` at the bottom of `assets/manifest.json` to reflect your local development hostname.

For example, if your local development URL is `http://project-name.dev` you would update the file to read:
```json
...
  "config": {
    "devUrl": "http://project-name.dev"
  }
...
```
If your local development URL looks like `http://localhost:8888/project-name/` you would update the file to read:
```json
...
  "config": {
    "devUrl": "http://localhost:8888/project-name/"
  }
...
```
